                <p>IDeATe, the Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology network at Carnegie Mellon, is an interdisciplinary program aimed at bringing students from all the six colleges together and providing learning opportunities for collaboration. For that purpose, IDeATe Gallery, an online portfolio making platform, was born to serve IDeATe students for better communication and improvement.</p>
                <p>We are challenged by IDeATe Gallery because most students hold misconception of it. IDeATe Gallery is intended to be <b>a learning tool and a collaborating community</b> where students can keep learning through iteration of their draft projects and interaction with others for feedback. However, for most users, IDeATe Gallery exists only as <b>a presentational tool</b> to showcase polished work. For them, neither iterations of their work nor communication with others is necessary.

                <p>The second-round research is used to narrow down the design scope. After first-round research, an idea about feedback loop sparked in our attempts to improve learning experiences in IDeATe Gallery. We used the second-round research to test whether the <b>feedback loop</b> idea is solid enough, and how this idea could help engaging students into communication and collaboration. We synthesized all our findings into six “How Might We” questions which started our design process.</p>

                    <b>Literature Review</b>
                    <br>
                    Portfolio-making, in its simplest form, entails documentation, curation, and presentation. The documentation step involves cultivation of information, and artifacts that demonstrate the learning/making process. The curation stage involves purposeful cherry picking and reflecting of documented information. The presentation step involves polishing and sharing with a targeted audience in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to literature review, portfolio making is not linear but naturally iterative. Continuous iterations occur at curation stage, where learning arise simultaneously.

                    <b>User Interview & Affinity Diagram</b>
                    <br>
                    IDeATe is made up of undergraduate and graduate students in CMU. To better understand portfolio-making process of college students, we initially interviewed four students with varied experiences in portfolio making and conducted think aloud with them while going through their websites. We synthesized data using affinity diagram to find out general requirements of portfolio makers. This synthesis model below represents what they are (conceptual requirements), what they need (dispositional requirements) and what they want (motivational requirements) in a portfolio making process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One interesting finding is, <b>interactions with others are essential in portfolio making process</b>. From literature review, we’ve already know that portfolio making is naturally iterative. During this messy process, external evaluation, guidance and feedback are greatly required by portfolio makers to help them make changes, learn new skills and get improvement.

                    We contacted nine IDeATe students and alumni who was active in IDeATe Gallery. We invited them to tell their portfolio making experiences with IDeATe Gallery, including their background and skill sets, motivations and challenges, likes and dislikes. All interviewees were mapped into two groups. The purple group represents novice who had project experience less than 2 years and the green group represents expert who had 2 years project experience or more. From the interview, <b>both novice and expert are engaged in feedback but from different perspectives</b>. Most novices are feedback-seekers while most expert are willing to give feedback.

                    <b>Stakeholder Interview</b>
                    <br>
                    We met with Kelly Deleany (Assistant Director of the IDeATe program) and Daragh Byrne (Creator of IDeAte Gallery) to talk about how IDeATe Gallery was intended to help students making portfolios. We wanted to know:  1) Establishment idea of IDeATe Gallery. 2) Design decisions they made under this idea. 3) What problems they are facing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kelly explained IDeAte Gallery was created as an interdisciplinary community where different departments from the university converge to learn from one another through communication and Daragh hoped Gallery to be a space where students could practice, improve, and eventually transfer what they learned to make highly-curated professional portfolios. Daragh mentioned that the two drivers of Gallery were documentation function and comment function, but currently the comment function was not active. He was worried students learned little from IDeATe Gallery because most students used Gallery as a showcasing tool. They just published their work on it without communications or interactions with others.

                    <b>Site Study</b>
                    <br>
                    To learn the inner workings and the internal culture of IDeATe, we conducted a site studies which combined direct observations and interviews together. We want to observe: 1) How IDeATe students learn and work in the site. 2) How IDeATe students interact with other students, TAs and faculties. 3) How they document their in-progress works while making (which is evidence for portfolio). At the same time, we want to interview: 1) How IDeATe students use IDeATe Gallery. 2) How IDeATe students think of IDeATe. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We found out that most IDeATe students <b>didn’t use IDeATe Gallery to document and curate their in-progress works</b>. They prefers other platforms including personal websites, class blogs and other portfolio making websites to do the documentation and curation stuff, where they could share their draft projects with friends or have class critiques to get feedback. As for IDeATe Gallery, most students used it only to showcase polished projects. One students mentioned that: ”Gallery only presents the final projects.”

                <p>
                   Why was IDeATe Gallery initially created as a learning tool but eventually used as a showcasing tool? We got the answer from our findings in first-round research:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) From the research towards portfolio making, we knew: <b>portfolio making is not linear but iterative. In this process, feedback is required as the guidance of iterations.</b>
                </p>
                <p> 
                   2) From the research towards users, we learned: <b>users can be divided into expert and novice in a specific field, and both of them value feedback for better improvement.</b>
                </p> 
                <p> 
                   3) From the research towards IDeATe Gallery, we found out: <b>IDeATe Gallery is used mostly as a showcasing tool but not learning tool, mainly because it fails to provide a learning environment where students are engaged into feedback giving and receiving. Students finsih documentation and curation outside IDeATe, and only use it for presentation.</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    According to our research findings, feedback is the key to solving IDeATe Gallery’s problem. We decided to design a <b>feedback loop</b> to help building collaborative and supportive learning environment in IDeATe Gallery. We believed that by building in better opportunity for feedback, both novice and expert students will be able to optimize their overall learning experiences through sharing their expertise and contributing to the community.

                <b>Culture Probe</b>
                <br>
                    We adopted a design probe to try out our feedback idea and understand the subtle qualities of experience. We designed two posters - one for expert to give feedback and one for novice to ask for feedback - and hung up them in the IDeAte space to probe students’ interactions. We prepared a packages containing sticky notes, emoji and conversational bubbles next to the posters, and waited for a week to see how students would leave or ask for feedback on the poster.

                <b>Paper Prototyping</b>
                <br>
                   We built paper prototype to observe users’ interactions when going through the feedback loop. This time, we were able to see real questions students would ask. By giving users some voice, we let them draw sketches they can relate to and ask questions that truly matter to them.

               <h1>Research Findings</h1>
                <p>
                   Through the second-round research, we found IDeATe students are engaged in feedback but there are several common questions existing in the feedback loop we designed. First, novices felt confused about how to clearly identify their questions in specific area. For instance, if a novice had some questions about her sketch of a cat house - which is a draft project for her laser-cutting class - she may feel struggling because she’s not sure the questions are about “laser-cutting”, “sketching” or “cat house”. Second, it’s hard for them to make clear and targeted problem description. Third, though novices want expert feedback, they had no idea who to ask and where to find them. In addition, experts also found difficulty to organize and express their feedback. We collected all their struggling and generated five “How might we”:
